# Proposing and Adding Examples

This page discusses how to add additional examples to this launcher.

All contributions must use the MIT License.

## Discuss
First, discuss your plans with the DevCenter Examples Manager
(Larry Kluger) via apihelp@docusign.com. He'll assign you an example number.

A new example can be added to any of the `eg-03-` series of
launchers, except for the curl repo.

After your new example has been accepted, the DevCenter team will
arrange to have it ported to the other SDK examples.

### New examples should be not too big, and not too small
Each example should cover a DocuSign feature "appropriately."

For example, if a feature offers two options then consider
having your example demonstrate both options.

### Self-contained
Examples should be self-contained within the scope of the
launcher.

For example, if your example operates on a template,
then either use the template created by example number 8,
or modify the template created by example 8 (eg add a field),
or programmatically create a new template.

If you plan to change example 8, first discuss with the
Examples Manager via apihelp@docusign.com.

Do not require a user to create or modify a template by
using the Admin tool.
